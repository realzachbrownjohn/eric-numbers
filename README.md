One day, a middle-school mathematics teacher named Eric posted a question on social media,
professing a mathematical riddle. His age was a palindrome one more than a prime. My first
thought was 8, though I figured he could not have aged *that* badly. Eric had turned 44 that
day if I recall correctly.

At this point, I thought that either this question had more solutions, or I was about to make
an interesting discovery concerning some bizarre relation between primes and palindromes. To
no surprise it was the former. By manually looking at a list of prime numbers, I replied:

"i’m not sure! presuming that you’re a youthful sub-6000 years old, you could be any of the
following ages: 3, 4, 6, 8, 44, 212, 242, 272, 434, 444, 464, 828, 858, 878, 888, 2112, 2222,
2442, 2552, 4004, 4664, and 4994."

With a cheshire grin, I went to bed, and woke up pleasantly to some media traction on my reply.
I knew, however, that I could do better, and that I had the programming knowledge to fulfil this
curiousity.

In the undertaking that proceeded, I not only aimed to fulfil an infinite
generation of solutions to Eric's problem, but to optimise the task as best I could.
I will avoid tedious detail, but I had noticed that all multi-digit solutions began with a
2, 4, or 8, and deduced that it would be far quicker to generate palindromes and check for
primes than to generate primes and check for palindromes. The resulting solution is primarily
a unique palindrome fetcher with an isprime() called somewhere.

Though it was my first completely novel coding experience, I hope you can appreciate the effort
more-so than its flaws. The following code, though short and simple, will forever exist as a fixed
point of my mind, as it beholds all rationality behind my passion for computer programming.
Eric Numbers is a program of algorithmic creativity and mathematical leveraging ultimately designed
for fun and laughs as the reader wonders just how much I must have had to go and make this.

I wrote this code in the earliest four hours of September 26, 2024.
Eric's original post appears to be deleted, but my original two replies are still online.
